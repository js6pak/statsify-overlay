# Statsify Overlay

A scuffed bedwars overlay, but with linux support.

TODO:

- [x] (scuffed) electron version upgrade
- [x] linux and appimage
- [ ] fullscreen
- [ ] companion forge mod (replacement for python autowho and tabshow)

### License concerns

In both [original](https://github.com/imconnorngl/overlay) and [closed sourced](https://statsify.net/overlay#download)
statsify-overlay, the only place where license is mentioned is inside `package.json`'s `license` field. From my research
it is not enough, so no matter what I do, improving on statsify overlay is not legally possible, if this repo is taken
down with DMCA, oh well, who cares?
